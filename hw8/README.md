## **Preface**

Praying for my hack3. 

GraphQL is not hard but is complicated.

Remember to `yarn start` both in `/hw8/frontend` and `/hw8/backend`!
## **Basic / Advanced requirements**

**Only basic requirements are completed.**

**Note: This is the image of hw7, but it should work alike in hw8. BTW There are no `info` messages now, one of which is shown in the image. Only `success` and `error` messages.**

## **Things worthy of attention**

Nah, nothing special.

### **Imporved autoscrolling**

When switching to a chatbox or sending a message in a chatbox, the page automatically scrolls to the bottom. I wasted a lot of time designing this so I want to mention it here ^w^|||.

### **New version of `antd` included.**

![](./README_IMAGES/antdjs.png)

Instead of `antd.css` or `antd.min.css` I included `antd.js` in `index.js`. Seems like a whole new version of `antd` module has been released recent weeks. All works fine on my computer. Hope they work fine on yours too...
